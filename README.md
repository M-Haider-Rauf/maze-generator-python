# maze-generator-python
A program for generating random and complete mazes, I made using Python and pygame...
So this is one of my favorite uses of backtracking... At it's core, this algorithm is used when you require ALL nodes of graph to
be traversed, in a random manner. 

# dependencies
pygame
for installing pygame open your command line and enter `pip install pygame`
make sure both files are in same folder, and run "main.py"
